# App Features

### Pick a Color if you have a specific idea in mind
- Users can choose an initial color using the color picker and view its HEX code, providing a convenient starting point for their color palette.

### If you need guidance
- Purpose: Users can specify the intended use of the colors (e.g. poster, website, interior decor...), ensuring the recommendations align with their needs.
- Audience: Users can describe their target audience, helping to tailor the color recommendations perfectly.
- Mood: Users can select a mood(e.g. happy, sad, love ...) for their colors, aiding in determining the ideal color palette.
- Keywords: Users have the option to input up to five custom keywords, influencing the output from OpenAI. This ensures that the generated suggestions remain coherent.

## Users will be able to see a preview of the color generated in a mock (e.g. website, card, component...), so that users can have a better understanding on how to use the color created by the generator

## Environment Variables Setup:

Create a .env file with a variable called `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, following the example below:

```bash
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=6c793695171e793d7d0080ad7700
```

### How to get OpenAI Api Key:

Go to [OpenAI API website](https://platform.openai.com) and login with your account, then navigate to [/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to generate your Personal Api Key.

Useful Guide:
[Managing your work in the API platform with Projects](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9186755-managing-your-work-in-the-api-platform-with-projects)

**Note**: You _do_ have to add credits in OpenAI to use their API, but $5,00 should last a few months, and it should be more than enough for this project pourpose, as we're not going to deploy our API keys.
